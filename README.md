# me-mauve-website

A landing page for my independent music project. The page was developed using HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript. I implemented styling using CSS and added effects via Javascript.

# Motivation
This project was created to serve as a means to help expose my music. Every time I release a new song or piece of content, I maintain the page tangentially. I'm constantly adding features to make the feel of the site more modern and user-experience-oriented.
